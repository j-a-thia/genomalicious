extra features. See Details for parameterisation.}

gene features. Default is NA, no border.}

\description{
Uses base positions information to make a linear plot of genetic features
to produce a gene map. Separates into "gene features" (plotted as large blocks
on the main chromosome) and "extra features" (plotted as small bars offset from
the main chromosome).
}
\details{
There are two major features plotted, "gene features" and
"extra features". These names are just for convention: gene features are
plotted as large coloured bars in center of the plot on the main "chromosome",
whereas extra features are plotted as small grey bars above/below the
gene features, offset from the main chromosome. Anything could be plotted as
a gene or extra feature, and these are specified through \code{gene_type}
and \code{extra_type}.

The name of the genetic feature being plotted is the value of \code{mapDT$NAME}.
This value is effectively evaluated as a mathematical expression to allow
italics for gene names and mixed formatting in gene names. The internal function
call is the evaluation of values by \code{geom_text(..., parse=TRUE)} and
\code{geom_text_repel(..., parse=TRUE)}.

The value of \code{mapDT$STRAND} dictates the position of the coloured bars.
A value of 1 places "genes" on the top of the genomic strand, whereas a value
of -1 places "genes" below the genomic strand.

The colour of the gene features is specified through \code{gene_colour} as
a named vector. If there are two genes, 'COX1' and 'COX2', specification of
their colours can be done like so: \code{c(COX1='pink', COX2='blue')}.
If colours are not specified, one colour is automatically assigned to each
unique "gene".

The value of \code{extra_ypos} specifies that distance of the extra features
from the gene features. Set larger if things are looking squashed.
Additionally, \code{plot_ymax} sets the maximal plotting area, so set this
value larger if things are not fitting well.
