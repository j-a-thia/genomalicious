\usage{
family_sim_compare(
  simGRM,
  obsGRM,
  plotColous = NULL,
  look = "ggplot",
  legendPos = "right",
  curveAlpha = 0.7,
  curveFill = NULL,
  curveOutline = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{simGRM}{Matrix: The simulated GRM using the individuals generated
from \code{family_sim_genos}. See Details.}

\item{obsGRM}{Matrix: The observed GRM using the observed individuals.
See Details.}

\item{look}{Character: The look of the plot. Default = \code{'ggplot'}, the
typical gray background with gridlines produced by \code{ggplot2}. Alternatively,
when set to \code{'classic'}, produces a base R style plot.}

\item{legendPos}{Character: Where should the legend be positioned? Default is
\code{'top'}, but could also be one of, \code{'right'}, \code{'bottom'},
\code{'left'}, or \code{'none'}.}

\item{curveAlpha}{Numeric: A value between 0 and 1 to set the transparency of
the density curves. Default = 0.7.}

\item{curveFill}{Character: A vector of colours to fill density curves,
but is an optional argument. Default = \code{NULL}. If specified, must be
a length of 5, with colours corresponding to the levels 'Unrelated', 'Cousins',
'Half-siblings', 'Siblings', and 'Observed', in that order.}

\item{curveOutline}{Character: A vector of colours to for density curve outlines,
but is an optional argument. Default = \code{NULL}. If specified, must be
a length of 5, with colours corresponding to the levels 'Unrelated', 'Cousins',
'Half-siblings', 'Siblings', and 'Observed', in that order.}

\item{numSims}{Integer: The number of simulated individuals for each family
relationship. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
Returns two objects. The first is data.table with the following columns:
\enumerate{
   \item \code{$SIM}, the simulation number for pairs of simulated individuals,
   or 'NA' for the pairs of observed individuals.
   \item \code{$SAMPLE1}, the sample ID for the first individual.
   \item \code{$SAMPLE2}, the sample ID for the second individual.
   \item \code{$FAMILY}, the familial relationship for simulated individuals.
   \item \code{$RELATE}, the estimated relatedness.
}

The second is a ggplot object which plots density curves for the estimated
relatedness values calculated for simulated pairs of unrelated individuals,
cousins, half-siblings, and siblings, with the observed relatedness values
from the user's dataset overlayed. Dashed lines are used to demarcate the
theoretical expected relatedness values for unrelated individuals (0),
cousins (0.125), half-siblings (0.25), and siblings (0.5).
}
\description{
This function can help compare observed estimates of relatedness to expected
values of relatedness for different familial relationships given a set of
loci and population alelle frequencies. It returns a data table combining
the simulated and observed estiamtes and a plot of density curves overlaying
the distribution of observed relatedness estimates on top of simulated values.
}
\details{
The function takes the output of \code{family_sim_genos} and additional calculations
of the genetic relationiship matrix (GRM) that are performed by the user on
the simulated and observed individuals.

The GRMs for arguments \code{simGRM} and \code{obsGRM} need to be
created by the user with whatever program they want to use to calculate
pairwise relatedness among individuals. The same function call should be used
ob both datasets. The GRM should be a square matrix with the relatedness of
individuals to themselves on the diagonal, and their relatedness to other
individuals on the off-diagonal.
